# Random Wikipedia Article

NOTE: Idea borrowed from this article [jorgegonzalez/beginner-projects](https://github.com/jorgegonzalez/beginner-projects#movie-of-the-day)

This script suggests a random Wikipedia article for you to read.

## Motivation
As curious people, we all love Wikipedia to explore random stuff - anything from the history of the interstate that goes through your town to the GDP of North Korea. I just wanted something that can suggest something I wouldn't even think of researching. 

## Usage
When you run the script by typing ``python3 script.py`` it will automatically retrives a random Wikipedia article for you to read by showing you the title. The script will then ask you if you would like to read the article - if you answer yes, then it will open the article in your default browser. If you say no, then it will suggest you another random Wikipedia article.
